# Standing On The Shoulders of Giants
It would have been impossible to build GoodLogik without the generosity and support of the open-source community. 

This is us giving back.

### Our Projects
- [good-ui](https://goodlogik.github.io/good-ui/) - Build complex user inferfaces with ease by combining the powers of ruby, slim and meta-programming. Preconfigured to work with [Semantic-UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)/[Fomantic-Ui](https://fomantic-ui.com/), and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
